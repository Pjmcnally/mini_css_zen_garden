# mini_css_zen_garden

This was originally an exercise in learning/practicing CSS.  

I was given [this image](https://github.com/Pjmcnally/mini_css_zen_garden/blob/master/mini_zen_css.png) and HTML (partially borrowed from CSS Zen Garden) and told to apply CSS to the HTML to replicate the image as closely as possible

To see the results [click here](https://pjmcnally.github.io/mini_css_zen_garden/).

I have subsequently modified the HTML slightly to make sure that all the links work and added a link back to this repo.  At this point it is a functioning static site hosted on GitHub Pages.
